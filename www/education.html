			<h2>Godly Play Sunday School</h2>
			<div class="inline_pictures">
				<img src="images/pic_2.jpg" alt="">
				<img src="images/pic_3.jpg" alt="">
			</div>
			<p>
				In addition to a toddler room and Youth Group, we have a Godly Play rooms. Our Godly Play Sunday school is all about stories. The teachers use beautifully crafted figurines to teach our children the stories of the Bible.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of Godly Play is to enable children to use sacred story, parable, liturgical action, and silence to become more aware of the mystery of God&#8217;s presence in their lives and in the community of children gathered for worship.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every Sunday, durring the school year, the biblical story is followed by a time of wondering. Some examples of these are:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				I wonder what you like best about this story? <br>
				I wonder what is the most important part of the story? <br>
				I wonder who you are in the story?
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Such questions are always open-ended and allow children to participate in the reflective process without fear of right or wrong answers. Wondering together is the community&#8217;s way of remaining open to the Holy Spirit and allowing the story to become part of our lives. This time of wondering shapes and deepens our relationship with God. Godly Play supports children as they find their own place in the Great Story and discover their unique identity as a child of God.
			</p>
			<h3>Toddler Room</h3>
			<div class="inline_pictures">

			<p>
				Our toddler room is led by Briana Griswold. During the week she is a preschool teacher for <em>Mi Escuelita Preschool</em> in Aromas. She has been a Pre-K Sunday school teacher for over 3 years and is now very happy to be bonding with the children at St Mary&#8217;s. She has been working with children for well over half her life and truly enjoys it. She also has a deep passion for art which she brings to the classroom.
			</p>
			<!-- [[[ USE IF NO NEW PERSON FOUND IN DECEMBER ]]]

				During the 10am service, parents may bring their little ones to the fabulous Toddler Room in Clay Hall. There they will be nurtured, cared for, and able to explore a variety of materials and books with their pals&mdash;new and old.

			<h2>Youth &amp; Family Ministries</h2>
			<h3>All God&#8217;s Children Services</h3>
			<p>
				Four Sundays a year St. Mary&#8217;s celebrates a special service for children at 10 a.m. These festive services provide an opportunity for all ages to worship together. They include simple hymns and songs, self-generated prayers, and a homily designed especially for children.
			</p>
			<!-- <h3>Summer of Fun</h3>
			<p>
				Summer of Fun is when Godly Play takes a break and parish adults volunteer to lead a 10:00am Sunday session for our K-5th grade kids. Volunteer leaders focus on a variety of activities including arts, crafts, baking, being of service to the parish, etc.
			</p> -->
