			<h2>Godly Play Sunday School</h2>
			<div class="inline_pictures">

			</div>
			<p>
				In addition to a toddler room and Youth Group, we have a Godly Play rooms. Our Godly Play Sunday school is all about stories. The teachers use beautifully crafted figurines to teach our children the stories of the Bible.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of Godly Play is to enable children to use sacred story, parable, liturgical action, and silence to become more aware of the mystery of God&#8217;s presence in their lives and in the community of children gathered for worship.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every Sunday, durring the school year, the biblical story is followed by a time of wondering. Some examples of these are:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				I wonder what you like best about this story? <br>
				I wonder what is the most important part of the story? <br>
				I wonder who you are in the story?
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Such questions are always open-ended and allow children to participate in the reflective process without fear of right or wrong answers. Wondering together is the community&#8217;s way of remaining open to the Holy Spirit and allowing the story to become part of our lives. This time of wondering shapes and deepens our relationship with God. Godly Play supports children as they find their own place in the Great Story and discover their unique identity as a child of God.
