			<h2>Godly Play <br> Sunday School</h2>
			<p>
				Our kids enjoy Godly Play where they engage faith through stories, wondering, conversation and activities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of Godly Play is to enable children to use sacred story, parable, liturgical action, and silence to become more aware of the mystery of God&#8217;s presence in their lives and in the community. Every Sunday the biblical story is followed by a time of wondering, guided by the Storyteller. This time of reflection is followed by a time of active response. Children choose from a variety of art materials to create their own responses to the lesson. Some children prefer to hear another story or will take down a story from the shelves and work with it on their own. The teachers encourage creativity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Godly Play is usually K&ndash;5th Grade. We also have a Toddler Room and a Youth Group.
