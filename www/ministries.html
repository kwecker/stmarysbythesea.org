Volunteers interview clients to assess their needs and also bag and distribute groceries; stock shelves; collect food from a variety of sources. Volunteers contribute to the ministry of CSC not only financially but also by donating time and food. This service is available to all walk-ins Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 1&#0150;2:45pm.
			</p>
			<h3>I-HELP</h3>
			<p>
				St. Mary&#8217;s belongs to this peninsula wide organization that provides food and shelter to homeless men enrolled in the outreach program.

Overnight shelter is provided in the parish hall.We also participate in a fairly new and similar program for women.

			<h3>Prayer Shawl Ministry</h3>
			<p>
				Inspired by former parishioner Ann Taugher, knitters gather monthly to create shawls for those who need &#8220;celebratory or comforting enfolding.&#8221; Recipients have been parishioners, friends of parishioners, relatives at a distance, CSC clients, mental health and social service families. Some recent occasions upon which shawls have been delivered are: graduation, bereavement, hospitalization, birth and relocation. Our shawls are made for all God&#8217;s children; anyone who needs a reminder of God&#8217;s love for them. Since September 2005 we have delivered over 240 shawls! It&#8217;s fun and free! Lessons are provided and knitters of all ages are welcome.
			</p>
			<blockquote class="prayer">
				<h3>Prayer of Blessing</h3>
				Warming, comforting, enfolding and embracing.<br>
				May this mantle be a safe haven...<br>
				A sacred place of security and wellness<br>
				Sustaining and embracing in good times as well as difficult ones.<br>
				May you receive this shawl and be cradled in hope,<br>
				Kept in joy, graced with peace, and wrapped in love.<br>
				Blessed Be!
