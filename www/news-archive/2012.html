				<h3>Volunteer Opportunities in the St. Mary’s Thrift Shop</h3>
				<p class="news_date">1/30/12</p>
				<p>
					Have you ever wanted to play store? Well, here&#8217;s your chance. Join the ladies and gentlemen that operate St. Mary&#8217;s Thrift Shop. All shifts are only three hours long&mdash;a small commitment with a great return. Please join us. You will meet lots of interesting people, while supporting the many projects that help those in need throughout our community. Each new volunteer is teamed up with an experienced worker, so you don’t have to have prior experience, or even be a member of the church.
				</p>
				<div class="expand_news">
					<p>
						Please call Judy Obbink, Thrift Shop Coordinator at (831) 373-7490 or the church office at (831) 373-4441 for more information, or to volunteer. Even one three hour shift per month would make a big contribution to the continued success of the shop and help make a difference in someone else&#8217;s life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don&#8217;t like retail? Consider joining the team that sorts and prices merchandise for the Thrift Shop. We have had several volunteers retire this past year and we need your help. Shifts are just three hours long, and it&#8217;s really fun sorting through treasures and preparing them for new homes. If you think you might be interested, please call Judy Obbink, (831) 373-7490 for more information. Thank you!

				<h3>Christian Social Concerns Ministry&mdash;Annual Report of Outreach in 2011</h3>
				<p class="news_date">1/23/12</p>
				<p>
					In 2011, Christian Social Concerns (CSC) was open 149 days. 2,677 households were served for a total of 5,425 individuals. A household may consist of a single homeless person or a family of five. Of the 5,425 individuals 779 were seniors and 1,118 were children. 2011 saw an increase in the number of homeless and seniors with a decrease in the number of children served.
				</p>
				<div class="expand_news">
					<p>
						351 Thrift Shop vouchers were used to help keep someone warm or look presentable for a job interview. 3,456 food bags were packed for an average of 23 bags each two-hour day. $19,214 was spent. 58% covered the cost of food, while the majority of the rest of it helped with shelter and transportation.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have contributed your time, food, financial resources or prayers, thank you for your support of this important ministry. You have made it possible for St. Mary&#8217;s to fulfill our mission to feed the hungry and contribute to the relief of those in need, to be &#8220;home&#8221; for them. For as Jesus said, &#8220;Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.&#8221;
					</p>
					<p>
						Please consider spending some time with this ministry. You don&#8217;t have to be a member of St. Mary&#8217;s to help. Our volunteers come from all over the Monterey Peninsula and represent many faith communities. All that is required is a desire to serve and help make a difference is someone&#8217;s life. If you could spare two hours once or twice a month, we would love to hear from you. Please call the church office for more information. (831) 373-4441. Financial contributions, food and prayers are also very much appreciated in our attempts to help those in need.

				<h3>Organic Farm Stand Continues at St. Mary&#8217;s by the Sea</h3>
				<p class="news_date">1/6/12</p>
				<p>
					Starting Sunday, April 25th, 2010 and continuing every Sunday thereafter, St. Mary&#8217;s has hosted a local organic farm stand, courtesy of the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA). ALBA&#8217;s The Harvest of Faith Farm Stand Project aims to bring healthy local produce to faith communities while supporting beginning, small-scale farmers. The farmers receive a fair price for their corps by selling directly to the consumer. In return, parishioners get fresh, affordable, organic produce while building solidarity with their local farmers.

						The farmers assigned to St. Mary&#8217;s are the Bucio brothers, Rigoberto and Adolpho. In 2008, Rigoberto graduated from ALBA&#8217;s Farmer Education Program where he and his younger brother learned organic agricultural practices and the tools to establish a successful business as small organic farmers.

						In the Spring of 2011, the first anniversary of our partnership, St. Mary&#8217;s hosted a successful event (Sowing Seeds of Friendship) to help raise awareness and funds for the program and to assist in supporting the brothers&#8217; educational endeavors. At the event we exhibited works of local artist, Warren Chang, whose oil paintings of figures in landscapes have won international acclaim. Warren has since made a painting of Rigoberto, which can be seen on <a href="http://www.warrenchang.com">Warren&#8217;s website</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beginning in the Fall, 2011 Rigoberto has had to spend his Sundays at the farm, and Adolpho (who is completing his first year at California State University Monterey Bay) has been at St. Mary&#8217;s each week to continue what feels like a long-standing tradition. Please, come and meet Adolpho, sample delicious, locally grown organic produce, and support this important project&mdash;where everyone is a winner.
