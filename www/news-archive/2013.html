				<h3>PYSANKY&mdash;Ukrainian Egg Painting Workshop a Great Success!</h3>
				<p class="news_date">2/23/2013</p>
				<img src="../images/news/eggs/egg3.jpg" alt="">
				<p>
					St. Mary&#8217;s by-the-Sea hosted a special Ukrainian egg painting workshop on Saturday, February 23rd. For centuries people of the Ukraine have written Paschal (Easter) greeting to friends and family members on eggs instead of paper. These messages of health, prosperity, wealth, and new life and hope are not expressed in ordinary script. Instead, they are incorporated in elaborate designs and symbols tediously written onto the egg shell.
				</p>
				<div class="expand_news">
					<img src="../images/news/eggs/egg1.jpg" alt="">
					<p>
						Pysanky comes from the Ukrainian verb &#8220;pysaty&#8221; meaning &#8220;to write&#8221;. Each egg is a unique masterpiece of inter-twining symbolism and color that will last indefinitely with proper care and handling.

				<h3>Volunteer Opportunities in the St. Mary's Thrift Shop</h3>
				<p class="news_date">1/30/12</p>
				<p>
					Have you ever wanted to play store? Well, here&#8217;s your chance. Join the ladies and gentlemen that operate St. Mary&#8217;s Thrift Shop. All shifts are only three hours long&mdash;a small commitment with a great return. Please join us. You will meet lots of interesting people, while supporting the many projects that help those in need throughout our community. Each new volunteer is teamed up with an experienced worker, so you don't have to have prior experience, or even be a member of the church.
				</p>
				<div class="expand_news">
					<p>
						Please call Judy Obbink, Thrift Shop Coordinator at (831) 373-7490 or the church office at (831) 373-4441 for more information, or to volunteer. Even one three hour shift per month would make a big contribution to the continued success of the shop and help make a difference in someone else&#8217;s life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don&#8217;t like retail? Consider joining the team that sorts and prices merchandise for the Thrift Shop. We have had several volunteers retire this past year and we need your help. Shifts are just three hours long, and it&#8217;s really fun sorting through treasures and preparing them for new homes. If you think you might be interested, please call Judy Obbink, (831) 373-7490 for more information. Thank you!
