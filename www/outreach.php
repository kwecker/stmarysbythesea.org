			<h1>Outreach</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Assistance to the Greater Community and the World</strong>
			</p>
			<h2>Our Programs</h2>
			<h3>Christian Social Concerns</h3>
			<p>
				This dedicated group of parishioners provides food, clothing and referrals for those in need who come to St. Mary&#8217;s for help. Assistance is provided each Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 1:00&ndash;2:45PM. In operation since 1965, volunteers provide help by interviewing clients, assessing their needs, bagging food and stocking shelves. Each Sunday a food basket is placed in the narthex of the church for donations and brought forward at the offertory at both services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please check in at the latest by 2:30PM. We are closed on some holidays. Please call to make sure we are open, (831) 373-4441.
			</p>
			<h3>Christmas Gifts</h3>
			<p>
				Each December, parishioners sign up to provide Christmas gifts for children whose families are receiving help from local Mental Health Services.
			</p>
			<h3>COPA&#0151;Walking Together</h3>
			<p>
				Walking Together (WT) is an outreach ministry of St. Mary&#8217;s that works for social justice in the Monterey Bay region. WT offers St. Mary&#8217;s parishioners an opportunity to participate in public life, taking the values of justice and respect for the dignity of every person and making them manifest in the world. We are developing the relationships and the skills of leadership, reflection, and action that can bring the good news to life.
